Computational Thinking Score is a web application that measures computational thinking skills, which are among the 21st century skills. This web application was also developed as a result of an academic investigation. It is a part from Emre COBAN's `me` master's thesis, [An Alternative Approach to Measuring Computer Thinking Skills: Performance Based Measurement](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/SearchTezWS?key=v7BkNnnepTnbhn8rNR77LXeeyRBIjrZrf1iZYbSbS0YmM8u2ri2fhhqriIe9S0gp "An Alternative Approach to Measuring Computer Thinking Skills: Performance Based Measurement"), which he wrote under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Özgen KORKMAZ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aNy_rIMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao "Prof. Dr. Özgen KORKMAZ").

## Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is the process of systematically approaching a problem and creating a solution. It includes a kind of skill group, which is based on problem solving skills and methods. This skill group is aimed at understanding and analyzing complex problems and developing solutions for the problem. Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking.

### The Components of Computational Thinking

- Problem Solving
- Creative Thinking
- Algorithmic Thinking
- Critical Thinking
- Recognition Pattern
- Abstraction
- Decomposition
